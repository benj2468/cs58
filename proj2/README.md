# Programming Project 2: Ledyard Bridge

## Running the Program

```
make ledyard && ./ledyard
```

You should pipe in a string of 1s and 0s that indicate the destination of the cars as they arrive at the bridge. I.E. 0101 indicates that a car destined for Hanover arrives, then a car for Norwich, then Hanover, then Norwich.
