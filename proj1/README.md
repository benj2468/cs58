# Benjamin Cape Programming Assignment #1

# Instructions

```
make album ARG=<arguments to pass in>
```

Arguments:
- `-d` : Will display the thumbnails upon requesting input
- `[... photos]` : You may list photos, seperates by a whitespace, or use wildcards to include full folders.

This will compile the code, run it with the provided arguments, create an HTML output file, and also run `pandoc` to generate a PDF of the output: `index.pdf`.

# Lifeline

My [lifeline](./Lifeline.pdf) represents the different processes and the tiered calling tree and dependencies.

# Tests

Tests can be generated by creating a new file `test<# test>.txt` in the `./test/` directory. To run a test, run:

```
make test TEST=<# test>
```

It will generate a `./test/test<# test>/index.html` - change that to be `truth.html` and then whenever you run tests again it will compare the newly generated `index.html` to the old `truth.html` file - if they differ the test will fail.

Somtimes you need to run the tests a few times - since it might swap the order of the photos in the test folder - since we use pipes :)
